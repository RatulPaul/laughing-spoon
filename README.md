Python Beginner projects

This project is basically a word guess game which is similar to hangman game.

You can very easily create this game just by having some basic knowldge of syntax

In this program I have used a set of words which are randomly chosen by machine using the random mosule.

Here in this game I have used enumerate function to spot the same words as many times as it is in the rndomly chosed word. 

Go through the code and you would be able to understand better
